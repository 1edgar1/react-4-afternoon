# routing-afternoon

## Instructions:

Goal: Create a web application with 4 different

## Setup:
* `Fork` and `clone` this repository
* `cd` into the project
* Run `npm install`;
    * One of the packages that was installed was `json-server`. This library will mimic a ReST api and allow you to make http requests for the student data.
* Run `npm start` to spin up the development server
* In a separate terminal, run `npm run api` to start the json-server.

## Step 1

### Summary

To begin our project, we will be installing the required dependencies and configuring the router.

### Instructions
* Install React Router.
* Create a new file in `src/` named `router.js`.
* Configure a router in `src/router.js`: 
    * Import `Switch` and `Route` from `react-router-dom`.
    * Import the following components to use as routes:
        * `src/components/Home/Home.js`
        * `src/components/About/About.js`
    * Use the following combinations of paths and components for your router:
        * Path: "/" - Component: `Home` - This path should be exact.
        * Path: "/about" - Component: `About`.

### Solution
<details>
<summary>src/router.js</summary>

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

import Home from './components/Home/Home';
import About from './components/About/About';

export default (
  <Switch>
    <Route component={ Home } exact path="/" />
    <Route component={ About } path="/about" />
  </Switch>
)
```

</details>

 - Run `npm install --save react-router-dom`

2. In index.js, import HashRouter from 'react-router-dom'
    - Wrap the App component with HashRouter.
3. Create a router.js file.
  - import Switch, Route from 'react-router-dom'
  - Create an empty export default statement using ( ).
  - Import the following components:
    - Home - This componenet will be the landing page of our application.
    - About - This component will be a page that displays information about the university. 
  - Inside the parentheses return a Switch component with nested Route components: 
    - Home: 
        - Set the path prop of this component to be "/".
        - Add the exact prop to this component.
        - Set the component prop of this component to be { Home }
    - About: 
        - Set the path prop of this component to be "/about".
        - Set the component prop of this component to be { About }

4. In this step, we will modify our App.js to render our router onto the DOM.
    - Import router from src/router.js
    - Render router below the nav tags. 
    - Import Link from 'react-router-dom'.
    - Locate the elements with className of links.
        - Wrap these elements in their own Link Component.
        - Home link should be sent to '/'.
        - About link should be sent to '/about'.


5. In our Home.js file we need the Math 1010 button to link to our ClassList component. 


6. In the ClassList.js component we will be making a call to get our data from the `json-server`. 
    - Make a get request to `http://localhost:3005/students` and display all the student names in a list on the screen.


7. Each of the student's names will need to link Student.js component passing up the student's id to the url as a parameter. 
    

8. The Student.js component will take the Student's id which was passed as a parameter in the url and will make an api call to `http://localhost:3005/students/` + id to get and display the student's information. 


9. The About.js component will have a nested routes to the History and Contact components.
